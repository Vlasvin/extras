The validity of visas may be limited by time or by the number of visits to the country. The necessary documents and their processing are individual in each case, and therefore the likelihood of refusal is quite high. The main reasons for refusal are errors in filling out the application form, as well as not knowing all the nuances when collecting documents to prove your ties to your home country. To avoid refusal, entrust us with submitting the documents for obtaining a visa to the country you need. Our experience combined with your determination will surely bring a successful result.",
